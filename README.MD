=========
Open Life is an [OpenFL](https://openfl.org) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org) based One Life client

* **MOD SUPPORT:** Open Life will be able to excute code in real time using [hscript](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript) and [cppia](https://haxe.org/manual/target-cppia-getting-started.html). A built in mod launcher. Tier one support for community based mods and full client architecture support.

* **High performance:** Uses an incredbily powerful display list system called Tilemap ([Demo](https://www.openfl.org/samples/bunny/)) to display all chunks, floors and sprites.

* **Multi target and language export:** Deploy to a [plethora of targets](https://github.com/openfl/lime#targets) with the stability of OpenFL, and multiple languages with haxe ranging from Javascript to C/C++, more info of [languages supported](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/compiler-targets.html).

* **Thoughtful, concise and efficent code:** Codebase continues to become as minimalistic as possible while also keeping the level of abstriction low.
