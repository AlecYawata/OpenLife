**DISCLAIMER: Project is still in progress, and is not usable from a player perspective yet, stayed tuned.**


Open Life is an [OpenFL](https://openfl.org) and [Haxe](https://haxe.org) based [OneLife](http://onehouronelife.com/) client

* **Ground up, MOD SUPPORT:** Open Life will be able to excute code in real time using [hscript](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript) and [cppia](https://haxe.org/manual/target-cppia-getting-started.html). A built in mod launcher. Tier one support for community based mods and client architecture needed.

* **High performance:** Uses an incredbily powerful display system called Tilemap ([Demo](https://www.openfl.org/samples/bunny/)) to display all tiles and sprites.

* **Multi target and language export:** Deploy to a plethora of targets with the stability of OpenFL, and multiple languages with haxe from Javascript to C/C++

* **Thoughtful, concise and efficent code:** Codebase is as minimalistic as possible while also keeping the level of abstriction low.
